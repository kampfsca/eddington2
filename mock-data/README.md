Mock Data for Testing
=====================

This folder contains three files:

- ride-gen.r
- rides.dat
- E\_expected.dat

Simulated ride data was created using *ride-gen.r*. 
The output of that simulation is stored in *rides.dat*.
The cumulative Eddington number of the data was output into *E\_expected.dat*.

The Eddington number of the data is 25.
